#  Write a program to calculate area of rectangle based on length and breadth.
length = float(input("Enter Length Value of Rectangle : "))
breadth = float(input("Enter Breadth Value of Rectangle : "))

Rectangle = length*breadth
print(f'length={length} and breadth={breadth} ==> Area of Rectangle is -->{Rectangle}')
